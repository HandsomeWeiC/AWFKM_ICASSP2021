This code is written by Matlab for the paper ADAPTIVE FEATURE WEIGHT LEARNING FOR ROBUST CLUSTERING PROBLEM WITH SPARSE CONSTRAINT

The demo shows the experimental test on 12-dimensional 64cluster dataset. The former two features is useful and the rest are added by Gaussian noise.

The demo code can be seen in test_AWFKM_v4.m and the concrete code for the proposed algorithm can be seen in the file funs.
